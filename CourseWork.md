PRE-REQUISITES
Knowledge: This course is directed at engineering students. Others who know the following topics are also welcome: Linear algebra (vectors and matrix arithmetic, projection of vectors, singular value decomposition), calculus (differentiation, partial derivatives, double derivatives, chain rule of derivatives), programming (preferably python, loops, conditions, functions, classes, programming best practices such as modularity, commenting, and informative variable naming).

Status: Student with a valid college ID card. Not restricted to India.

Study Materials: Please go through the following before April 15:

Basic mathematics for machine learning (linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics), such as Mathematics for Machine Learning (https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf). It will be better if you actually do all the math by hand on paper and pencil while following the material. Just reading it is not enough for retention of concepts.
Basics of Python programming such as Learn Python (https://www.learnpython.org/). There are many other good ones too.
